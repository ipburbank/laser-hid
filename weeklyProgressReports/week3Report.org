This week we worked more on the software and the laser circuits.

* Istvan
I worked on adding automatically-generating documentation to the code which we will be able to export to HTML and include in our project page.
Additionally, I helped James a little with the laser control circuits.
Lastly, I started the physical assembly of the device.
