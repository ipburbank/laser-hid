      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        An image projector that draws using colored lasers controlled by a PIC32.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use several colored lasers to generate a single pixel.
        A system of mirrors deflects the lasers to control where they shine.
        A vertical mirror controls the height of the projected laser.
        A spinning mirror assembly causes the laser to &quot;scan&quot; horizontally.
        The spinning mirrors always spin at constant speed while the software outputs pixels.
        The vertical mirror changes position at the end of every row.

      <h2>High-level design</h2>
      <p>
        The horizontal mirrors are four mirrors on the sides of a spinning cube.
        A single row of the output display is shown in the time it takes for one of the four spinning mirrors to move through part of it's arc.
        Each rotation of the mirror assembly is thus four rows.
        The rotation of the mirror assembly is used to control the beginning of a row via a phototransistor and Change Notification interrupt.
        DMA outputs the entire row into our diode control circuits, with a timer controlling the time between pixels.
        The interrupt for the end of the DMA block transfer is used to configure the DMA and the vertical mirror for the next row.

      <h2>Software Design</h2>

      <h3>Framebuffer</h3>
      <p>
        The rows to project are stored in a two-dimensional array of C structs.
        This struct uses bitfields, implementation-specific behavior, and a "bit packing" pragma to ensure that each struct fits in exactly a byte.
        Thus a single byte can  be directly copied into the PORTB register to output the bits.
        This allows the DMA to transfer draw pixels without software intervention.
        An implementation-defined &quot;struct punning&quot; technique is used to convert these bit-packed structs into a numeric type when they must be written to the port without DMA.
      </p>

      <h3>Projector</h3>
      <p>
        Our projector implementation makes heavy use of hardware timing.
        That is, the projector code consists of several event-driven actions which are triggered by various hardware events.
      </p>
      <p>
        DMA is used to output pixels to the lasers.
        When a horizontal scan line starts, DMA is configured to output the entire row, one pixel per period of timer A.
        Timer A is free running, and its period determines the aspect ratio of the pixels.
        The DMA transfer of the row is enabled by a Change Notification ISR which runs when the optical transistor is triggered.
        We configured the Change Notification via registers directly because our version of plib is missing the macros.
        Because this PIC32 cannot distinguish between rising and falling edges when triggering the Change Notification ISR, we simply check the value of the pin in software.
        Thus, effectively, the rising edge of the optical transistor triggers the start of a row being output.
        Because the optical transistor is driven by the spinning mirror carousel, the timing of the rows is too so spinning the carousel faster would result in faster output of rows.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a row finishes the DMA triggers an interrupt that increments the Y-axis mirror's position.
        The reason it is done immediately at the end of a line is to ensure the mirror has time to settle into its new position before the start of the next row.
        The mirror is incremented linearly on each row until it reaches the bottom of the frame then it wraps around again to the top.
        Because the increment is triggered by the DMA which is triggered the spinning carousel, spinning the carousel faster would cause the Y-axis mirror's scan rate to increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last two paragraphs made claims about the timing of the projector with respect to the carousel.
        In fact, spinning the carousel faster would increase the frame rate without any software changes.
        As the software stands now, the aspect ratio would change but that could be configured out (as the mirror spins faster the rows would get wider).
        The aspect ratio is determined by the period of the timer that triggers cell transfers in the DMA.
      </p>

      <h4>Failed attempt to use one fewer ISR</h4>
      <p>
        An earlier design attempted to use the gated mode of Timer1 to control the DMA and avoid the Change Notification ISR.
        The idea was that each timer period would start a cell transfer, but the timer would only run when a row had to be output.
        The edge caused by the phototransistor circuit was used to asynchronously set an external flip-flop high and the flip-flop output was used as the gate signal.
        The flip-flop would be asynchronously set low in the end of row ISR before the DMA was configured for the next row.
        This would have meant that an ISR was not required at the beginning of the row, only at the end.
        We abandoned this because the non-obvious but documented behavior of gated timers is to generate an interrupt when the gate input goes low and deactivates the timer, rather than on period match.
        This caused the DMA cell transfers to never fire.
      </p>

      <h3>Rendering library</h3>
      <p>
        We ported the TFT drawing library to be backed by our framebuffer rather than by the TFT.
        Due to the simplicity of the framebuffer interface, only rendering_drawPixel in the ported library had to be aware of the framebuffer.
        However, a number of functions in the interface to the original TFT library were written in a way that was tied to the TFT hardware, presumably for efficiency reasons.
        We rewrote these functions in terms of rendering_drawPixel to minimize dependence between the projector and the rendering library.
        This payed off when slightly changing the projector interface midway through the project required minimal changes to the rendering library.
        Additionally, the color representation of the original TFT library had to be replaced with our color struct, requiring very minor changes throughout the entire library.
        We added morse code drawing functions to the rendering library as a demonstration.
        All of the graphics in the demo are drawn using this library.
