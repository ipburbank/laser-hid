      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        An image projector that draws using colored lasers controlled by a PIC32.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use several colored lasers to generate a single pixel.
        A system of mirrors deflects the lasers to control where they shine.
        A vertical mirror controls the height of the projected laser.
        A spinning mirror assembly causes the laser to &quot;scan&quot; horizontally.
        The spinning mirrors always spin at constant speed while the software outputs pixels.
        The vertical mirror changes position at the end of every row.

      <h2>High-level design</h2>
      <p>
        The horizontal mirrors are four mirrors on the sides of a spinning cube.
        A single row of the output display is shown in the time it takes for one of the four spinning mirrors to move through part of it's arc.
        Each rotation of the mirror assembly is thus four rows.
        The rotation of the mirror assembly is used to control the beginning of a row via a phototransistor and Change Notification interrupt.
        DMA outputs the entire row into our diode control circuits, with a timer controlling the time between pixels.
        The interrupt for the end of the DMA block transfer is used to configure the DMA and the vertical mirror for the next row.

      <h3>Projector</h3>
      <p>
        Our projector implementation makes heavy use of hardware timing.
        That is, the projector code consists of several event-driven actions which are triggered by various hardware events.
      </p>
      <p>
        DMA is used to output pixels to the lasers.
        When a horizontal scan line starts, DMA is configured to output the entire row, one pixel per period of timer A.
        Timer A is free running, and its period determines the aspect ratio of the pixels.
        The DMA transfer of the row is enabled by an ISR which runs when the optical transistor is triggered.
        Thus, effectively, the rising edge of the optical transistor triggers the start of a row being output.
        Because the optical transistor is driven by the spinning mirror carousel, the timing of the rows is too so spinning the carousel faster would result in faster output of rows.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a row finishes the DMA triggers an interrupt that increments the Y-axis mirror's position.
        The reason it is done immediately at the end of a line is to ensure the mirror has time to settle into its new position before the start of the next row.
        The mirror is incremented linearly on each row until it reaches the bottom of the frame then it wraps around again to the top.
        Because the increment is triggered by the DMA which is triggered the spinning carousel, spinning the carousel faster would cause the Y-axis mirror's scan rate to increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last two paragraphs made claims about the timing of the projector with respect to the carousel.
        In fact, spinning the carousel faster would increase the frame rate without any software changes.
        As the software stands now, the aspect ratio would change but that could be configured out (as the mirror spins faster the rows would get wider).
        The aspect ratio is determined by the period of the timer that triggers cell transfers in the DMA.
