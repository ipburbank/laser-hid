      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        An image projector that draws using colored lasers controlled by a PIC32.

      <p>
        We use several colored lasers to generate a single pixel.
        A system of mirrors deflects the lasers to control where they shine.
        A vertical mirror controls the height of the projected laser.
        A spinning mirror assembly causes the laser to &quot;scan&quot; horizontally.
        The spinning mirrors always spin at constant speed while the software outputs pixels.
        The vertical mirror changes position at the end of every row.

      <h2>High-level design</h2>
      <p>
        The horizontal mirrors are four mirrors on the sides of a spinning cube.
        A single row of the output display is shown in the time it takes for one of the four spinning mirrors to move through part of it's arc.
        Each rotation of the mirror assembly is thus four rows.
        The rotation of the mirror assembly is used to control the beginning of a row via a phototransistor and Change Notification interrupt.
        DMA outputs the entire row into our diode control circuits, with a timer controlling the time between pixels.
        The interrupt for the end of the DMA block transfer is used to configure the DMA and the vertical mirror for the next row.

      <h2>Hardware Design</h2>
      The entire project is assembled on a piece of plywood.
      The circuits are distributed between two prototyping boards which are loosely taped down to the plywoood.
      Long wires are also taped down to the plywood to avoid loose wires.

      <h3>Horizontal mirrors</h3>
      <p>
        The horizontal mirrors are held on to a 3D assembly with zipties and glue.
        The assembly has no top surface and is mostly hollow.
        The top part has four sides, each with a mirror attached on the outside.
        The bottom part is a disk with four slots cut in the sides that reach all the way into the hollow center.
        Each slot is aligned with the middle of the face with a mirror attached.
        The angle of the mirrors to vertical is precisely calibrated by pieces of paper slipped behind the mirrors to push the top edge out (the bottom edge is glued).
        The 3D printed assembly is glued to a salvaged compouter fan, which is screwed to the plywood.
      </p>

      <h3>Phototransistor and emitter</h3>
      <p>
        The emitter is hung at the bottom of the hollowed out interior of the mirror rotation assembly by a stiff wire screwed into the wood base.
        The phototransistor is similarly held on a wire just outside of the spinning mirror assembly.
        The precise position of the phototransistor is used to calibrate the horizontal position of the rows.
        <!-- TODO: phototransistor circuit -->
      </p>

      <h3>Vertical mirror</h3>
      <p>
        The vertical mirror sits on a stack of wood glued down to the plywood.
        It is held down by tape temporarily so that the precise angle can be easily calibrated.
        The distance of the vertical mirror from the spinning mirror assembly partially determines the distance between rows, along with software tunable settings.
        The vertical mirror slightly deflects lasers vertically before they hit the spinning assembly, which deflects them side-to-side.
      </p>

      <h3>Laser platform</h3>
      <p>
        The mirror platform is a piece of wood with nuts glued to it.
        Bolts screwed through the nuts can be used to adjust the height and angle.
        The laser diotes are hot-glued down to the platform and hand-calibrated to shine at roughly the same point.
        Additional easily configurable software calibration can adjust for some physical calibration errors.
      </p>

      <h3>Diode control circuits</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO -->
      </p>

      <h3>DAC for vertical mirror</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO -->
      </p>

      <h3>Power supply</h3>
      <p>
        Parts of the DAC circuit are supplied with 5V from a salvage power adapter.
        The fan is supplied with 12V from the same adapter.
        The diode control circuits are supplied with 3.3V from a bench power supply.

      <h2>Software Design</h2>

      <h3>Framebuffer</h3>
      <p>
        The rows to project are stored in a two-dimensional array of C structs.
        This struct uses bitfields, implementation-specific behavior, and a "bit packing" pragma to ensure that each struct fits in exactly a byte.
        Thus a single byte can be directly copied into the <span class="snippet">PORTB</span> register to output the bits.
        This allows the DMA to transfer draw pixels without software intervention.
        An implementation-defined &quot;struct punning&quot; technique is used to convert these bit-packed structs into a numeric type when they must be written to the port without DMA.
      </p>

      <h3>Projector</h3>
      <p>
        Our projector implementation makes heavy use of hardware timing.
        That is, the projector code consists of several event-driven actions which are triggered by various hardware events.
      </p>
      <p>
        DMA is used to output pixels to the lasers.
        When a horizontal scan line starts, DMA is configured to output the entire row, one pixel per period of timer A.
        Timer A is free running, and its period determines the aspect ratio of the pixels.
        The DMA transfer of the row is enabled by a Change Notification ISR which runs when the optical transistor is triggered.
        We configured the Change Notification via registers directly because our version of plib is missing the macros.
        Because this PIC32 cannot distinguish between rising and falling edges when triggering the Change Notification ISR, we simply check the value of the pin in software.
        Thus, effectively, the rising edge of the optical transistor triggers the start of a row being output.
        Because the optical transistor is driven by the spinning mirror carousel, the timing of the rows is too so spinning the carousel faster would result in faster output of rows.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a row finishes the DMA triggers an interrupt that increments the Y-axis mirror's position.
        The reason it is done immediately at the end of a line is to ensure the mirror has time to settle into its new position before the start of the next row.
        The mirror is incremented linearly on each row until it reaches the bottom of the frame then it wraps around again to the top.
        Because the increment is triggered by the DMA which is triggered the spinning carousel, spinning the carousel faster would cause the Y-axis mirror's scan rate to increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last two paragraphs made claims about the timing of the projector with respect to the carousel.
        In fact, spinning the carousel faster would increase the frame rate without any software changes.
        As the software stands now, the aspect ratio would change but that could be configured out (as the mirror spins faster the rows would get wider).
        The aspect ratio is determined by the period of the timer that triggers cell transfers in the DMA.
      </p>

      <h4>Failed attempt to use one fewer ISR</h4>
      <p>
        An earlier design attempted to use the gated mode of Timer1 to control the DMA and avoid the Change Notification ISR.
        The idea was that each timer period would start a cell transfer, but the timer would only run when a row had to be output.
        The edge caused by the phototransistor circuit was used to asynchronously set an external flip-flop high and the flip-flop output was used as the gate signal.
        The flip-flop would be asynchronously set low in the end of row ISR before the DMA was configured for the next row.
        This would have meant that an ISR was not required at the beginning of the row, only at the end.
        We abandoned this because the non-obvious but documented behavior of gated timers is to generate an interrupt when the gate input goes low and deactivates the timer, rather than on period match.
        This caused the DMA cell transfers to never fire.
      </p>

      <h3>Rendering library</h3>
      <p>
        We ported the TFT drawing library to be backed by our framebuffer rather than by the TFT.
        Due to the simplicity of the framebuffer interface, only <span class="snippet">rendering_drawPixel</span> in the ported library had to be aware of the framebuffer.
        However, a number of functions in the interface to the original TFT library were written in a way that was tied to the TFT hardware, presumably for efficiency reasons.
        We rewrote these functions in terms of <span class="snippet">rendering_drawPixel</span> to minimize dependence between the projector and the rendering library.
        This payed off when slightly changing the projector interface midway through the project required minimal changes to the rendering library.
        Additionally, the color representation of the original TFT library had to be replaced with our color struct, requiring very minor changes throughout the entire library.
        We added morse code drawing functions to the rendering library as a demonstration.
        All of the graphics in the demo are drawn using this library.
      </p>

      <h3>Lab3 port</h3>
      <p>
        We mostly completed a port of the simulation, animation, and game logic parts of our Lab 3 Firehose game implementation.
        This involved using the new rendering API instead of the original TFT graphics API, and using new types for color and position.
        Additionally, due to bizarre limitations of Protothreads, we needed to strip it from the Lab3 code.
        The removal of Protothreads actually allowed a considerable simplification because we never made use of the more advanced synchronization features.
        The trimpot was to be replaced by a analog joystick, chose for generality.
        We wrote a joystick library using the ADC, but it became irrelevant in the limited final form of the project.
        Due to the unexpected limitations of the display, we never had a chance to test this port.
